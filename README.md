# !(!Dots || !Boxes)
Hackathon victims

Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players (sometimes more).
Instructions: Click and drag to draw a line between two dots. If you close a box you score a point and take another turn.
It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, dot to dot grid, boxes, and pigs in a pen.

There are two ways to start the game:
 - Clone the repository and open the index.html file.
 - Open our [website](https://multikushi.github.io/not-notDots-or-notBoxes/) and enjoy the game
